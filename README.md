# Computational Finance with MATLAB
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed during Semester 5 at the University of Luxembourg (September 2023 - January 2024).

The project explores the use of numerical methods to solve portfolio optimization problems in computational finance. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation in MATLAB to determine the extent to which such tools can effectively be applied in real-world financial scenarios.
