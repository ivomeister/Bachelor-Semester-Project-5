The current folder contains 6 files - "main.m" is the file that runs the program, while the rest correspond to the 5 functions that comprise the it.
To run the "main.m" file, one must have MATLAB installed (potentially requires a license).
The file folder must be opened in MATLAB, either as a regular folder or as a project, and the program is executed by clicking the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor interface for the "main.m" file.
Before running, make sure that all files are in the same folder or else a missing file error could occur.
